# Introduction
I was tired of going out and seeing what the weather was like outside. Tired of using the google weather application. This simple weather application will only display the current weather for a given area.

Also, I always wanted to know how a REST API consumption works.

While learning NodeJS, I wanted to do something simple and fast. This project, is a web application allowing me to display the weather, temperature...

# API
API is an acronym for Applications Programming Interface. An API is therefore a programming interface that allows you to "plug in" to an application to exchange data. It operates on an input/output agreement, it is a distribution channel. A API is open and offered by the program owner. It is a concept and an intangible element.
